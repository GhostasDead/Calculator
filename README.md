# Calculator
A simple calculator made with C# windows form

Its the first windows form application I developed.

I wrote all the code on my own according to my previous studies.

and optimized the code so it will never crash.

I will see other people codes and repos to improve the app later.


# In planning features:
-inputting negative numbers.

-inputting using keyboard.

-reduce the code length by merging some similar events.

-more complicated opreations.

-brackets and power ups.

-doing more than one operation without the need to press '=' every time.

-more impressive design and colors.
